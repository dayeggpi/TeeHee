dayeggpi built TeeHee as a free, open-source application. This Software is provided by dayeggpi and is intended for use as is.

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use TeeHee.


Summary
-------

TeeHee is designed with privacy in mind. In short:
- We do NOT collect any personal data
- We do NOT transmit any data to external servers
- All your data stays on YOUR computer
- We do NOT use analytics or tracking
- We do NOT display advertisements


Information Collection and Use
------------------------------

TeeHee does NOT collect any personal information.

TeeHee does NOT:
- Collect usage statistics
- Track your typing or keystrokes beyond what's necessary for text expansion
- Send any data to external servers
- Use analytics services
- Display advertisements
- Require an account or registration
- Require an internet connection to function


Local Data Storage
------------------

TeeHee stores the following data LOCALLY on your computer:

1. Triggers Database (triggers.json)
   - Location: %APPDATA%\TeeHee\triggers.json (default) or custom location
   - Contains: Your text expansion triggers (input/output pairs)
   - Purpose: To provide text expansion functionality

2. Settings File (settings.json)
   - Location: %APPDATA%\TeeHee\settings.json
   - Contains: Application preferences (trigger speed, custom database path)
   - Purpose: To remember your preferences

This data is:
- Stored only on your local computer
- Never transmitted to us or any third party
- Fully under your control
- Deletable at any time by you


Clipboard Access
----------------

TeeHee accesses the Windows clipboard in the following situations:

1. When you use the {{clipboard}} placeholder in a trigger
   - TeeHee reads the current clipboard content to insert it
   
2. When performing text expansion
   - TeeHee temporarily uses the clipboard to paste expanded text
   - Your previous clipboard content is restored after expansion

We do NOT:
- Store clipboard history
- Transmit clipboard content anywhere
- Log or record clipboard content


Keyboard Monitoring
-------------------

TeeHee uses a system-wide keyboard hook to detect when you type trigger text. This is necessary for the core functionality of text expansion.

Important:
- Keystrokes are processed locally in real-time
- We do NOT log, store, or record your keystrokes
- We do NOT transmit keystroke data anywhere
- The keyboard buffer only holds the last few characters needed to detect triggers
- The buffer is cleared after each trigger expansion


Third-Party Services
--------------------

TeeHee does NOT integrate with any third-party services.

TeeHee does NOT:
- Connect to the internet for any functionality
- Use cloud storage
- Integrate with external APIs
- Use third-party analytics
- Display third-party content


Data Security
-------------

Your data security is ensured by:
- All data stored locally on your computer
- No network transmission of any data
- No external dependencies for core functionality

The security of your data depends on:
- Your computer's security
- Your Windows user account protection
- Your backup practices


Data Export and Deletion
------------------------

You have full control over your data:

Export:
- Use the Export feature in Settings to backup your triggers
- Manually copy the JSON files from %APPDATA%\TeeHee\

Delete:
- Use the app to delete individual triggers
- Delete the entire %APPDATA%\TeeHee\ folder to remove all data
- Uninstalling the app does NOT automatically delete your data (so you can reinstall without losing triggers)
